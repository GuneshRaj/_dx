Below is a concise, executive-ready framing for the IPA (Intelligent Process Automation) initiative only, aligned to how your boss has been pushing you to think: business-first, execution-realistic, and outcome-driven.

Intelligent Process Automation (IPA) – Initiative Framing

⸻

1. Background & Problem Statement
	•	Compliance and operations teams rely heavily on manual, fragmented, and semi-automated processes across multiple systems, emails, documents, and forms.
	•	Existing RPA capabilities address task automation, but struggle with judgement-based workflows, exception handling, document understanding, and human-in-the-loop processes.
	•	This results in long processing cycles, high operational cost, inconsistent controls, and audit exposure.
	•	There is no unified layer to orchestrate processes end-to-end, intelligently route decisions, and capture institutional process knowledge.

⸻

2. Key Optimization / Opportunity Areas
	•	Compliance process orchestration – investigations, reviews, escalations, approvals, and reporting.
	•	Document-heavy workflows – onboarding, reviews, regulatory submissions, evidence compilation.
	•	Exception handling & human-in-the-loop flows – where RPA stops and people must intervene.
	•	Cross-system coordination – emails, core systems, portals, case tools, data lake, and RPA bots.
	•	Operational visibility – real-time dashboards, bottlenecks, SLA breaches, audit trails.

⸻

3. Strategic Rationale
	•	Move from task automation → intelligent process automation.
	•	Position IPA as the control and intelligence layer above RPA, not a replacement.
	•	Leverage COE’s process discovery, data lake, and automation catalogue as enterprise foundations.
	•	Establish a scalable platform to support compliance modernization, audit readiness, and AI enablement.
	•	Reduce structural dependency on manual operations while preserving governance and accountability.

⸻

4. Proposed Solution Direction
	•	Implement an IPA platform that:
	•	Orchestrates workflows end-to-end across people, systems, and RPA bots.
	•	Uses AI/ML components for document understanding, routing, recommendations, and prioritization.
	•	Supports human-in-the-loop execution (review, approval, exception handling).
	•	Provides a central dashboard for:
	•	Work queues
	•	Approvals and interventions
	•	Process monitoring
	•	Audit evidence
	•	Integrates natively with:
	•	Internal RPA services
	•	Compliance systems
	•	Data lake and process catalogue
	•	Security and access control layers
	•	Progress via vendor evaluation → controlled POC → board-approved scale implementation.

⸻

5. Expected Outcomes
	•	30–60% reduction in manual compliance processing effort.
	•	Measurable improvement in cycle time, SLA adherence, and error reduction.
	•	Clear audit trails, decision transparency, and operational controls.
	•	A reusable enterprise capability for:
	•	Compliance
	•	Risk
	•	Operations
	•	Future AI agents and autonomous workflows.
	•	Strong foundation for regulatory-grade AI automation across the organization.

If you want, next I can compress this into:

• a 1-slide board version
• a COE strategy paper version
• or a problem-led narrative your boss can directly present upward








Risk Name	Risk Type	Description	Probability	Mitigation / Strategy
Incomplete process understanding	Scope / Delivery	Underlying compliance processes not fully understood, leading to wrong automation design.	Medium	Run structured process discovery with BU and RPA teams; validate workflows with SMEs before design freeze.
Over-automation without controls	Operational / Compliance	Automation implemented without sufficient human checkpoints, increasing regulatory risk.	Medium	Enforce human-in-the-loop design, approval gates, and exception handling as mandatory IPA standards.
User adoption resistance	Change / Adoption	Users may resist dashboard-driven workflows or bypass automated processes.	Medium	Early BU involvement, UX co-design, role-based dashboards, structured training and change program.
Weak integration readiness	Technical	Legacy systems or APIs may not support real-time orchestration.	Medium	Early technical due diligence, integration assessment, fallback RPA/API hybrid approach.
RPA dependency instability	Technical / Delivery	Internal RPA bots may be fragile or not enterprise-grade.	Medium	Stabilize RPA library, implement monitoring, version control, and bot certification process.
Data quality limitations	Technical	Poor data quality affects decisioning and AI recommendations.	Medium	Data readiness assessment, cleansing pipeline, and manual override mechanisms.
Security and access gaps	Security / Compliance	Improper access control could violate compliance and audit expectations.	Low	Enforce RBAC, segregation of duties, audit logging, and security design review.
Unclear governance ownership	Governance	Blurred accountability between COE, BU, IT, and RPA teams.	Medium	Define IPA operating model, RACI, and escalation framework before build.
Vendor over-promising	Vendor / Commercial	IPA vendors may overstate intelligent capabilities.	Medium	Scenario-based demos, sandbox POC, and contractual performance clauses.
POC does not scale	Technical / Strategic	Successful POC may fail at enterprise volumes.	Medium	Design POC on production-like scale and require scalability benchmarks.
Compliance sign-off delays	Governance	Compliance validation cycles may delay deployment.	Medium	Embed compliance reviewers into sprint reviews and stage gates.
Process fragmentation	Operational	Multiple automation approaches create silos.	Low	Central process registry, shared data lake, and standardized workflow architecture.
Cost escalation	Financial	Licensing, infra, or integration costs exceed forecast.	Medium	Stage-gated funding, TCO modeling, and early commercial validation.
Model decision liability	Regulatory / Risk	AI-driven recommendations create accountability risk.	Low	Decision explainability, human override, and audit traceability enforced.
Parallel operations risk	Operational	Running automated and manual flows together creates confusion.	Low	Clear operating procedures, cutover planning, and runbook governance










Below is a structured High-Level Requirements table for IPA (Intelligent Process Automation), explicitly aligned to your operating model:

• intelligent automation
• human-in-the-loop execution
• dashboard-driven orchestration
• compliance-grade control and auditability
• integration with existing RPA, data lake, and enterprise systems

The wording is intentionally board- and vendor-ready, not tool-specific.

How this should be positioned in your initiative

IPA is not “advanced RPA.”

It is:

An orchestration layer that manages processes, people, bots, data, and AI as one operational control plane.

RPA becomes a task executor, not the brain.

The IPA platform becomes:

• the workflow brain
• the compliance spine
• the operational cockpit
