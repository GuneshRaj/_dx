Risk Name	Risk Type	Description	Probability	Mitigation / Strategy
Incomplete process understanding	Scope / Delivery	Underlying compliance processes not fully understood, leading to wrong automation design.	Medium	Run structured process discovery with BU and RPA teams; validate workflows with SMEs before design freeze.
Over-automation without controls	Operational / Compliance	Automation implemented without sufficient human checkpoints, increasing regulatory risk.	Medium	Enforce human-in-the-loop design, approval gates, and exception handling as mandatory IPA standards.
User adoption resistance	Change / Adoption	Users may resist dashboard-driven workflows or bypass automated processes.	Medium	Early BU involvement, UX co-design, role-based dashboards, structured training and change program.
Weak integration readiness	Technical	Legacy systems or APIs may not support real-time orchestration.	Medium	Early technical due diligence, integration assessment, fallback RPA/API hybrid approach.
RPA dependency instability	Technical / Delivery	Internal RPA bots may be fragile or not enterprise-grade.	Medium	Stabilize RPA library, implement monitoring, version control, and bot certification process.
Data quality limitations	Technical	Poor data quality affects decisioning and AI recommendations.	Medium	Data readiness assessment, cleansing pipeline, and manual override mechanisms.
Security and access gaps	Security / Compliance	Improper access control could violate compliance and audit expectations.	Low	Enforce RBAC, segregation of duties, audit logging, and security design review.
Unclear governance ownership	Governance	Blurred accountability between COE, BU, IT, and RPA teams.	Medium	Define IPA operating model, RACI, and escalation framework before build.
Vendor over-promising	Vendor / Commercial	IPA vendors may overstate intelligent capabilities.	Medium	Scenario-based demos, sandbox POC, and contractual performance clauses.
POC does not scale	Technical / Strategic	Successful POC may fail at enterprise volumes.	Medium	Design POC on production-like scale and require scalability benchmarks.
Compliance sign-off delays	Governance	Compliance validation cycles may delay deployment.	Medium	Embed compliance reviewers into sprint reviews and stage gates.
Process fragmentation	Operational	Multiple automation approaches create silos.	Low	Central process registry, shared data lake, and standardized workflow architecture.
Cost escalation	Financial	Licensing, infra, or integration costs exceed forecast.	Medium	Stage-gated funding, TCO modeling, and early commercial validation.
Model decision liability	Regulatory / Risk	AI-driven recommendations create accountability risk.	Low	Decision explainability, human override, and audit traceability enforced.
Parallel operations risk	Operational	Running automated and manual flows together creates confusion.	Low	Clear operating procedures, cutover planning, and runbook governance










Below is a structured High-Level Requirements table for IPA (Intelligent Process Automation), explicitly aligned to your operating model:

• intelligent automation
• human-in-the-loop execution
• dashboard-driven orchestration
• compliance-grade control and auditability
• integration with existing RPA, data lake, and enterprise systems

The wording is intentionally board- and vendor-ready, not tool-specific.

IPA High-Level Requirements Table

Category	High-Level Requirement	Detailed Description
Process Orchestration	End-to-end workflow orchestration	The platform must orchestrate complex multi-step business processes across systems, users, and bots, managing sequencing, dependencies, and state persistence from initiation to completion.
Human-in-the-Loop Control	Configurable decision and approval points	The system must support configurable human intervention points where workflows pause for user approvals, exception handling, or data enrichment before resuming automatically.
Operational Dashboard	Unified process control dashboard	The solution must provide a centralized dashboard for users to view tasks, approve actions, resolve exceptions, retrieve information, and monitor live process status.
Intelligent Automation	Context-aware task execution	The platform must leverage rules and AI models to route work, pre-populate decisions, classify cases, and recommend actions while allowing human override.
Exception Management	Structured exception handling	The solution must support explicit exception flows, including retries, alternate routing, escalation, and human takeover, without breaking the main workflow.
Integration Layer	Enterprise system connectivity	The platform must integrate with core banking, compliance systems, RPA bots, document systems, and the enterprise data lake via APIs and event mechanisms.
RPA Coordination	Orchestration of internal RPA assets	The IPA platform must trigger, monitor, and manage internally developed RPA automations as execution workers within end-to-end processes.
Data & Content Handling	Intelligent document and data usage	The system must ingest structured and unstructured data, invoke document extraction and classification services, and use enriched data within workflows.
Decision Support	AI-assisted recommendations	The solution should provide decision support capabilities such as risk scoring, prioritization, next-best-action suggestions, and anomaly flagging.
Audit & Traceability	Full activity and decision audit trail	Every system action, human decision, data change, and exception must be logged with timestamps, users, inputs, and outputs for compliance and audit purposes.
Security & Access Control	Role-based workflow governance	The platform must enforce RBAC, segregation of duties, approval hierarchies, and environment access controls aligned with compliance requirements.
SLA & Performance Management	Workflow performance monitoring	The solution must support SLA definitions, turnaround tracking, backlog monitoring, and automated escalation on breaches.
Scalability & Resilience	Enterprise-grade execution platform	The platform must scale horizontally, support high-volume workloads, ensure fault tolerance, and allow non-disruptive upgrades.
Configuration & Change	Low-code process design capability	The system should support low-code/no-code workflow modeling, versioning, testing, and controlled deployment of process changes.
Reporting & Optimization	Process analytics and improvement	The platform must provide analytics on cycle times, bottlenecks, human intervention rates, and automation ROI to support continuous optimization.

How this should be positioned in your initiative

IPA is not “advanced RPA.”

It is:

An orchestration layer that manages processes, people, bots, data, and AI as one operational control plane.

RPA becomes a task executor, not the brain.

The IPA platform becomes:

• the workflow brain
• the compliance spine
• the operational cockpit

If you want, I can next produce:

• IPA POC evaluation scorecard
• IPA operating model (COE–RPA–BU interaction)
• Vendor RFI requirement pack (IPA-specific)
• Board-level IPA scope definition slide

Just tell me which one you need.
