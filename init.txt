🎯 POC Objective

Demonstrate that AI-driven False Positives Reduction supported by Anomaly Detection can materially reduce alert volume, accelerate low-risk case turnaround, and improve investigation efficiency without degrading true-risk detection.

📊 Core KPIs for the POC

🔥 1. Alert Volume Reduction (Primary Success KPI)

Definition:
Percentage reduction of alerts sent to human investigators compared to current baseline.

Formula:
(1 − Alerts_after / Alerts_before) × 100

Target for POC:
✅ ≥ 30% reduction (good)
🎯 40–60% reduction (excellent)

Why this is realistic:
Mature false-positive engines in AML typically deliver 30–70% reduction once calibrated.

⸻

⚡ 2. Low-Risk Auto-Resolution Rate

Definition:
Percentage of low-risk alerts that can be confidently auto-closed or straight-through-processed.

Formula:
Auto-resolved low-risk alerts / total low-risk alerts

Target:
✅ ≥ 25% (minimum viable success)
🎯 40%+ (high-impact result)

Business meaning:
Direct manpower deflection.

⸻

⏱️ 3. Turnaround Time (TAT) Improvement

Definition:
Reduction in average time to close low-risk alerts.

Baseline example:
Current: 2–5 days per alert

Target:
✅ 50% reduction in TAT
🎯 >70% reduction for low-risk alerts

Example result:
3 days → same day or <24 hours.

⸻

🧠 4. Investigation Productivity Gain

Definition:
Increase in alerts handled per investigator per day.

Formula:
Post-POC alerts per analyst / Baseline alerts per analyst

Target:
✅ 1.5× improvement
🎯 2× improvement

Why this matters:
This is the metric management understands instantly.

⸻

🛡️ 5. Risk Retention / Detection Integrity (Control KPI)

Definition:
Percentage of known true-positive or escalated cases still detected after suppression.

How to measure:
Replay 6–12 months of historical alerts including SAR/STR-filed cases.

Target:
✅ ≥ 95% retention
🎯 ≥ 98% retention

This protects you politically and regulatorily.

⸻

🧩 6. Anomaly Detection Contribution

This proves the second module is not “nice to have”.

KPI 6A – New Risk Signal Discovery

% of high-risk alerts that originate from anomaly models rather than existing rules.

Target:
✅ ≥ 10%
🎯 15–25%

KPI 6B – False Positive Differentiation

% of alerts reclassified more accurately using behavioural baselines.

Target:
✅ ≥ 20% improvement in alert quality score.

🧾 POC Success Statement You Can Use

“The POC will be deemed successful if the combined False Positives Reduction and Anomaly Detection modules achieve at least a 30% reduction in investigator alerts, a 50% improvement in low-risk turnaround time, and a minimum 1.5× increase in analyst productivity, while retaining at least 95% of known true-positive detections. Stretch objectives include exceeding 40% alert reduction and demonstrating that at least 10–20% of meaningful risk signals originate from anomaly-based detection.”
