Below is a structured High-Level Requirements table for IPA (Intelligent Process Automation), explicitly aligned to your operating model:

• intelligent automation
• human-in-the-loop execution
• dashboard-driven orchestration
• compliance-grade control and auditability
• integration with existing RPA, data lake, and enterprise systems

The wording is intentionally board- and vendor-ready, not tool-specific.

IPA High-Level Requirements Table

Category	High-Level Requirement	Detailed Description
Process Orchestration	End-to-end workflow orchestration	The platform must orchestrate complex multi-step business processes across systems, users, and bots, managing sequencing, dependencies, and state persistence from initiation to completion.
Human-in-the-Loop Control	Configurable decision and approval points	The system must support configurable human intervention points where workflows pause for user approvals, exception handling, or data enrichment before resuming automatically.
Operational Dashboard	Unified process control dashboard	The solution must provide a centralized dashboard for users to view tasks, approve actions, resolve exceptions, retrieve information, and monitor live process status.
Intelligent Automation	Context-aware task execution	The platform must leverage rules and AI models to route work, pre-populate decisions, classify cases, and recommend actions while allowing human override.
Exception Management	Structured exception handling	The solution must support explicit exception flows, including retries, alternate routing, escalation, and human takeover, without breaking the main workflow.
Integration Layer	Enterprise system connectivity	The platform must integrate with core banking, compliance systems, RPA bots, document systems, and the enterprise data lake via APIs and event mechanisms.
RPA Coordination	Orchestration of internal RPA assets	The IPA platform must trigger, monitor, and manage internally developed RPA automations as execution workers within end-to-end processes.
Data & Content Handling	Intelligent document and data usage	The system must ingest structured and unstructured data, invoke document extraction and classification services, and use enriched data within workflows.
Decision Support	AI-assisted recommendations	The solution should provide decision support capabilities such as risk scoring, prioritization, next-best-action suggestions, and anomaly flagging.
Audit & Traceability	Full activity and decision audit trail	Every system action, human decision, data change, and exception must be logged with timestamps, users, inputs, and outputs for compliance and audit purposes.
Security & Access Control	Role-based workflow governance	The platform must enforce RBAC, segregation of duties, approval hierarchies, and environment access controls aligned with compliance requirements.
SLA & Performance Management	Workflow performance monitoring	The solution must support SLA definitions, turnaround tracking, backlog monitoring, and automated escalation on breaches.
Scalability & Resilience	Enterprise-grade execution platform	The platform must scale horizontally, support high-volume workloads, ensure fault tolerance, and allow non-disruptive upgrades.
Configuration & Change	Low-code process design capability	The system should support low-code/no-code workflow modeling, versioning, testing, and controlled deployment of process changes.
Reporting & Optimization	Process analytics and improvement	The platform must provide analytics on cycle times, bottlenecks, human intervention rates, and automation ROI to support continuous optimization.

How this should be positioned in your initiative

IPA is not “advanced RPA.”

It is:

An orchestration layer that manages processes, people, bots, data, and AI as one operational control plane.

RPA becomes a task executor, not the brain.

The IPA platform becomes:

• the workflow brain
• the compliance spine
• the operational cockpit

If you want, I can next produce:

• IPA POC evaluation scorecard
• IPA operating model (COE–RPA–BU interaction)
• Vendor RFI requirement pack (IPA-specific)
• Board-level IPA scope definition slide

Just tell me which one you need.
